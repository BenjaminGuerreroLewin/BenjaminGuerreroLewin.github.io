## About Me

Benjamin Guerrero is a PhD student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Syracuse University.
His interests include developing theoretical frameworks to assess sediment transport in mountainous environments, testing model predictions through numerical and flume experiments, and using these predictions to evaluate the drivers of landscape evolution at geological timescales.
He is currently developing new techniques to quantify landslide erosion at millennial timescales and predict how both hillslopes and rivers change in response to these extreme events.
